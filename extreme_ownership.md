# Extreme Ownership

* "Relax. Take a look around. Make a call."
* All responsibility for success and failure falls on the leader; the must own
  everything in their world; the leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit
  failures, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to win.
* If individuals on the team aren't performing at the required level, the leader
  must mentor and bring them up; if mentoring fails, the leader must be loyal to
  the team and the mission and make the tough call to terminate them.
* The leader's attitude sets the tone for the entire team; they drive
  performance or they don't.
* Teams need a forcing function to get the different members working together to
  accomplish the mission and that is what leadership is all about; pulling the
  different elements of the team together to achieve success.
* No bad teams, only bad leaders.
* To convince the team, the leader must be a TRUE BELIEVER in the mission;
  you've got to understand and believe in the mission, to convince you team to
  believe in the mission; if you don't believe, you won't take the risks
  required to achieve success.
* Ask questions of those in command above you to get answers when you don't
  believe in or understand the mission.
* Ego gets in the way of taking constructive criticism, learning, and making
  necessary changes for success. Set your ego aside.
