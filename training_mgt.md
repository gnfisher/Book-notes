# Mentorship, Coaching, Sponsoring

## Mentorhsip
- problem solving hat on
- most helpful when beign onboarded, or starting a new role
- respect, give advice that is current and relevant to the person.
- mentee is not a threat, you want them to grow beyond you, share praise
- a personal fit, difference in values undermine the relationship, you may not
  be a good fit always.

## Coaching
- Mentoring; focused on problem and solution
- Coaching: focused on the person; open questions + reflections
- Problem solving on pause. First we need to understand the shape and nature of
  the problem.
- As a coach we are their fiercest champion

### Open Questions
- increases dopamine
- dopamine = better thinking, feeling better
- top negotiatiors ask twice as many open questions
- ask from a place of respect and honest interest
- getting out of problem solving mode lets you get better insight into what the
  problem even is
- therapy = past and personal focused; coaching = future and work focused;
- "I am not a therapist, i can help you with this stuff, but if you want help
  with this other stuff, you might benefit from seeing a therapist"
- "WHAT" not "WHY" (accusatory) not "HOW" (problem solving)

Example questions:

- whats important about this? whats hard about this?: what does success look
  like?
- what is it you are optimizing for?

### Reflections
- reflect back what you're hearing; i.e. they say they're frustrated about their
  boss; "so you want to talk about your relationship with boss?; "no actually
  the projects they give me are bad!"
- Here's what I know to be true about you
- Lets reflect on where you were this time last year
- "I feel like I'm parroting" but other person probably doesn't feel that way...
  its nice to see someone listen hard and work hard to understand what you said.
- whent hey are venting... when they are running out steam, is the time to
  intervene and checkin and ask an open question. what do you need to be
  successful? etc
- "WHAT" is important in the open questions "do you think" vs "what do you
  think"?
- Fact gathering questions are a good place to start and get bearings, but the
  open ended questions should point towards feeling questions eventually. e.g.
  "What is your gut telling you?" "What's feeling stuck?"
