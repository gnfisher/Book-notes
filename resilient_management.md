# Resilient Management

## Ch 1 - Meet your team

Reading Notes:

- Six core needs in the work place: BICEPS
  - Belonging
  - Improvement/Progress
  - Choice/Autonomy
  - Equality/Fairness
  - Predictability
  - Significance
- These are the "core needs". Everyone optimizes for different things; some are
  more important to one person than another.
- Everyone reacts to stimuli differently, and how *you* react may not be how you
  team reacts. One stimuli can threaten your Belonging core-need, but for
  someone else threatens their Choice/Autonomy, etc.
- Get an idea of your team's work style and preferences, the author uses a
  series of questions for a first 1:1 [which can be found in this
  document][first1on1qs]
  - How do they like to receive praise (public, private)
  - How do they like to receive feedback (in person, in the moment, email)
  - How do they want to be supported?
    - *What makes 1:1s valuable for you?*
    - *What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?*
    - *What do you need from your manager?*
    - *What do you need from your teammates?*
- Who are you as a leader and what do you optimize for? For getting shit done?
  For growing future leaders? On keeping the team happy? For keeping the team
  unstuck and moving forward? For long term relationships?

Coaching Questions:

- Which core BICEPS needs comes up the most often for you?
  - Belonging (am I good enough to be here); Improvement (am I growing and
    getting better and acquiring new valuable skills for my future?)
- What do you *wish* you could optimize for in the day-to-day of your manager
  role?
  - Growth/Long term relationships. I would like to help folks make progress in
    their careers and find resilience in themselves and their skills. And map
    that to more than the short term goals.
- What sort of introspection have you avoided doing with your teammates so far?
  Why?
  - Any at all? I'm not sure what to ask or how to ask it. I'm not sure what
    they want from me. I'm not sure what is even meant by this question - what
    introspection are we supposed to be doing?
